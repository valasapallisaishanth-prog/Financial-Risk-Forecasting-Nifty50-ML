# Financial Risk Forecasting using Machine Learning (Nifty50)

## Project Overview
This project predicts financial risk (volatility) using historical Nifty50 stock index data.
The goal is to forecast next-period volatility and classify high-risk market conditions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- Statsmodels (ARIMA)
- SQLite
- Matplotlib

## Models Implemented
1. Random Forest Regressor
2. ARIMA Time Series Model

## Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE
- MAE

## Database Integration
Predictions are stored in SQLite database for reporting and business use.

## Business Impact
- Identifies high-risk volatility periods
- Helps in portfolio risk management
- Supports quantitative decision-making
